We are assured that the program covers a wide range of topics, all highly relevant to the Linux community, accessible to attendees with different levels of expertise and brought by experienced speakers who have been on duty for a long time. Despite the great line-up from last year’s linuxdev-br, we believe that the current program surpassed it by far, and we are both glad and proud of the agenda we were able to assemble.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://cfp.linuxdev-br.net/2019/schedule/\">full program</a>.
